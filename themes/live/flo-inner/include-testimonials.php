Condition: Painful Periods, PMS, Acne </strong><br />
<br />
When I turned 25, my health suddenly started going down the tubes. I was chronically stressed out. I lived all the time in an ever-fluctuating world of emotional turbulence. My skin was very broken out in acne. And my periods were terrible. <br />
<br />
Eventually, a dear friend suggested that I contact Alisa to see if she could help. At the time, the six-month program felt like a lot of money to me, but I realized that being successful in my life was dependent upon my health, so I made the investment to work with Alisa privately for those six months. <br />
<br />
Something amazing happened during that time. She helped me transform my relationship to my body. I began to really talk to my body. Food became a source of nourishment and joy, instead of angst. My skin's health improved. And I began to really see where I was letting boundaries get crossed all the time in my life in various relationships. Alisa guided me in developing a very healthy and beautiful relationship with my anger, and I am now excellent at speaking my truth in the moment when a boundary has been crossed. <br />
<br />
I now know that unless I get outside and lie down in the grass or walk under the moon during the days before my period, I will have an unpleasant period. So, having quality communion with nature during that time before my period has become a tradition every month in my life, and my relationship to my womanhood and nature has deepened significantly. <br />
<br />
Alisa taught me how to more fully nurture myself, and it impacts every area of my life. My life is richer, healthier and more beautiful because of it, and I feel profound gratitude. My hope is that every woman has access to the incredibly valuable wisdom and guidance of Laughing Sage Wellness. <br />

Condition: Low Libido </strong><br />
<br />
I originally came to Laughing Sage for the specific purpose of doing something to restore my libido, which had "gone missing" with the onset of menopause.   I had no idea that it would turn out to be such a life-changing experience. Throughout the 3 months I've worked with Alisa, I've redefined my concept of sexuality, and I've fallen in love with a new way of being that has allowed me to live and love more fully every day.  I've refocused my personal goals and redefined for myself what "life success" really means to me.  Alisa is an amazingly wise, caring, insightful and intuitive woman. Her ability to &quot;get me&quot; really made a huge difference in my ability to change. The program more than exceeded my expectations...it made me a new woman! <br />

Condition: PCOS, Acne </strong><br />
<br />
I was diagnosed with PCOS three and a half years ago. The diagnosis was good news for me, since it explained all the frustrating symptoms that I had been experiencing for years! I had horrible cystic acne that kept getting worse no matter what I did. I couldn't seem to lose the 5-10 lbs of weight after my last pregnancy. My periods were always irregular and I had strong pelvic pain in my left abdomen. I felt trapped because every book I read said that there was no cure for PCOS, and that other than taking strong medications certain symptoms would not be relieved. I was never a fan of drugs and decided to research on my own to overcome PCOS. I didn't find an answer until I stumbled upon LSW. <br />
<br />
Throughout my 3-month program I surprised myself by not only meeting all the goals that I wanted to achieve, but also accomplishing things I never expected. My skin cleared up, my ovarian pain diminished, I lost the rest of my baby weight, and most importantly I found an amazing sense of peace in my life overall - peace with body image, having another child, my work. <br />
<br />
Emotionally, my lines of communication and boundaries in relationships are clearer and healthier. My sexual relationship with my husband has blossomed. I feel more productive in my life - even in everyday chores. Life is more fun! I am completely letting go and couldn't feel more free and light about doing so! <br />
<br />
LSW's approach is different than anything I have ever tried and so effective at achieving results. <br />

Condition: PCOS </strong> <br />
<br />
When I came to Laughing Sage Wellness in late 2005 struggling with PCOS, I hadn't had a full period in at least 6 months, I was miserably working 12 hours a day as an attorney, and I had been unintentionally celibate for the better part of a year. <br />
<br />
Late one evening, still at the office, I spoke to Alisa Vitti about my situation. I was highly resistant to working with LSW, but she suggested that I used a technique that I still use today. She asked me to pretend that I had made the decision not to have sessions with LSW, and see how that felt in my body. I checked in with myself and my body felt tight and shut down, in other words, &quot;normal&quot;. Then I pretended that I had signed up for sessions at LSW. At that moment, my body felt shaky, but alive. I started to cry, which is something I hadn't done for months. I signed up for a 6-month program that night. <br />
<br />
I can attest to tangible results. In working with Alisa, my cycle normalized to a great extent and I began getting full periods more often. I spent less time at the office and more time having fun, including dating. I also learned how to better feed my body and feel good in my body. <br />
<br />
But working with LSW meant more to me than just tangible results. The women at LSW brought me to my own internal labyrinth. At LSW, I began the journey toward healing my relationship with my femininity and my feminine energy. I started to incorporate and appreciate those parts of me that I had denigrated in the past. And LSW gave me a community of women who supported me in my healing journey. <br />
<br />
Now I work only part time as an attorney and I'm spending the rest of my time doing things that I really love, like working with plus-sized women who want to feel great without dieting (Body Love Wellness), writing, performing improv, and spending time with my boyfriend and friends. I can't imagine this journey without the support of LSW. <br />

Condition: PCOS </strong> <br />
<br />
I grew up an active, successful teenager who seemed to have it all. I was in impeccable shape and to the outside observer, my life looked perfect. I never had periods and I was ok with that. In fact, I liked it. I wanted to have control over my body. I had way too many things to do to slow down and deal with menstruation. I wanted the power, the consistency, the follow through...no messy emotions, no messy bleeding. Men had that. Why couldn't I? It seemed to be so much easier to get around in the world. So what if I had to take drugs for my acne and my unwanted hair growth. So what if I was continually anxious and exhausted. The drugs worked and I kept up with my busy, important schedule. And on the outside it all looked so pretty and perfect. <br />
<br />
At the age of 17, I was diagnosed with PCOS. One would think this would begin the story of my healing, but it only took me further into the abyss of disconnection with my body. My doctors told me that I had no choice but to go on the pill. Quotes like &quot;cancer&quot; and &quot;never being able to have children&quot; were repeated. They promised birth control wouldn't change who I was. They promised this was the healthiest and honestly, the only way to treat my &quot;disorder&quot;. For the next 10 years I searched doctor after doctor to find someone who might have an alternative method. They all fed me the same story, F.E.A.R. <br />
<br />
Laughing Sage burst into my life when I was at my wits end. I received the email blasts for over a year without ever even reading them! I just didn't believe that something so seemingly simple could have an impact. One day, I finally read Alisa's testimonial and something clicked. I began a 6-month program and for the first time in my life, I felt truly known. It wasn't easy to change my habits. It was terrifying to go off the pill and have my doctor and family not really understand or support me. I even thought that giving up my &quot;control methods&quot; would somehow hurt me. But, Laughing Sage gave me the knowledge and the support to begin trusting my own instincts again. They gave me permission to listen to something deeper. And I have learned that control and power over the body is something very different from what a majority of the medical community teaches. <br />
<br />
Today, I am finishing my 9th healthy, happy menstrual cycle in a row! And the truth is, every single aspect of my life has changed since I began my program with Laughing Sage. This is not an exaggeration. By taking the time to learn to listen and appreciate my menstrual cycle, I am finding the deepest FLOW in my life, my career, my relationships, and most importantly my daily dealings with my SELF. Everything is easier. Everything is lighter. The energy I used to keep it all looking so &quot;perfect&quot; is now flowing into ENJOYING my life. And that to me is POWER. <br />

Condition: PCOS, Fertility </strong> <br />
<br />
I've suffered from extremely irregular, heavy and painful periods since I was 17 years old. I always knew something was wrong - despite what my GYN told me - but I could not seem to get her to treat the cause of my irregular periods. I remember asking her &quot;is this going to affect my fertility?&quot; and she replied, &quot;Well, if you don't ovulate, you can't get pregnant&quot;. I wanted to treat the problem but when she learned I was not trying to have children at that time, all she wanted to do was push the pill on me again. Feeling like I had no recourse, I relented and went back on the pill again. <br />
<br />
Several years later, I got married and it came time for us to think about starting a family. After several months of being off of the pill and not yet ovulating, I went back to the GYN. I then had an ultrasound, which confirmed that I had PCOS, although by this time I had done my own research and already realized I had it. The emotional roller coaster was horrendous. I was on medication, I had injections, I was monitored daily via ultrasound, I lost my first pregnancy, and finally after 2 1/2 years I was pregnant with my son. <br />
<br />
While staying home with him, I noticed the PCOS symptoms were coming back. The weight gain was stubborn and once again, I was depressed. I knew about Laughing Sage from a friend of mine and lurked on the site for several months until I decided I would sign up for a free tele-class that Alisa was giving. I really didn't know what to expect. I was so tired of exercising to the point of physical exhaustion without seeing results, I I knew I wanted to have another child, and so I figured if I started working on this now, maybe I could cut out a lot of the pain suffered the first time around. <br />
<br />
The big change for me happened during the Spring Cleanse. I started experiencing intense levels of anger. It turned out, I had unresolved emotions related a violent act I suffered when I was 17 (also the age when my periods stopped). At this point, I realized PCOS was not just about food and my pancreas, there was a lot of emotional work I needed to do. I needed to allow myself to enjoy life and do things that were good for me. I needed to learn to speak up for myself and finally be the adult woman I wanted to be. <br />
<br />
Four months after completing the program, I got a period! It has been regular since then. 
 Six months after completing the program, my skin was clear, and my blood work was normal and my ovaries were back down to normal size. My current GYN was amazed! She noticed the difference as soon as she came into the examining room. <br />
 <br />
By the time my son was about a year old, we started thinking of giving him a sibling. We just assumed we would have to go through infertility treatment again. I just didn't think changing my food habits could increase my ability to conceive. We were told we had to try to 6 months and then seek infertility treatment. Two months after trying to conceive, we conceived our second son. <br />
<br />
The pregnancy was extremely easy and uneventful. While having a routine ultrasound, we learned all of my ovarian cysts were gone. I remember the tech saying to me &quot;I am looking at your ovary now&quot;. I recall being confused because I could not see them. You see I used to define my ovaries by the cysts on them. I could not find the cysts and I kept asking, &quot;Where is my ovary?&quot; And my husband exclaimed, &quot;The cysts are gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
I didn't suffer from post-partum depression as I did with my first son, and breast-feeding was possible. Two years later, I am still eating whole grains and greens. I focus on living abundantly and I am still working on speaking up for myself. <br />
<br />
I signed up with Laughing Sage expecting them to tell me how to eat; instead, I learned how to live a fulfilling and healthy life. Thanks for reading! <br />

Condition: Ovarian Cysts </strong> <br />
<br />
My healing journey began in February at my annual OB/GYN exam. A routine sonogram to check a fibroid revealed that I had developed cysts - one on each ovary measuring 2 centimeters. To me that seemed pretty large (and I checked on a ruler)! These weren't like two little pimples! I had had no pain, no symptoms of a problem. How could this be?! Would I have to have surgery? I've never had surgery! I don't want surgery! When I asked my doctor about proactive steps, her only advice was to monitor them and she would see me in two months for another sonogram. WHAT??!! <br />
<br />
Not being one to just sit around for two months and do the whole &quot;wait and see&quot; thing, I immediately reached out to my gal pals. Come to find out, they all have had or have cysts, too! Evidently a common issue, my dear friend, Margaret, didn't hesitate for a moment and said, &quot;You HAVE to call Alisa&quot;. What do they say? When the student is ready, the teacher will appear? Well...I was SO ready and she appeared! I was willing to try anything. I had nothing to lose and hopefully, something to gain. <br />
<br />
My initial sessions with Alisa focused on my lifestyle - diet, activities, relationships, the emotional work I was doing with my life coach, etc... It seemed that she was more interested in seeing how our work together could compliment what I was already doing in my life - which I loved! It was all about the positive and working in conjunction. She put me on supplements to help my body process hormones better. I started drinking more water. That was coupled with food experiments - what healthy foods satisfied and sustained me. I wasn't eating nearly enough fruits and veggies, so that was increased. <br />
<br />
Then - about a month into my program - it came time for the Spring Cleanse. You eat &quot;gentle foods&quot; - veggie soups, whole grains, fruit, veggie juices - to help your liver detox your body. No bread, no cheese, no milk, no caffeine! GULP! How was I going to make it through a whole week...and work?! Well...I did. And it was the best thing! I felt better...lighter...both physically and emotionally. Everything seemed clearer...my thoughts...even my skin! That week taught me to slow down, to nurture, to look inside, and to get rid of the things in my outer world that simply weren't necessary anymore. <br />
<br />
Now it's mid-April and time to go back for another sonogram. Alisa and I spoke prior to my visit and she told me not to expect any changes...that it was too soon. I was fine with that. I knew I was doing all I could and they were great things for my health nonetheless. So as I lay on the table, with no expectations, the technician tells me, &quot;The cyst on the left ovary is gone&quot; and then &quot;Oh! The one on the right is gone, too!&quot; I'm in shock. I'm elated. And as a tear rolls down my cheek, I'm in awe of the power...the power this body has to heal itself. How amazing is that! If I treat it right (if I treat ME right), then amazing things will happen. <br />
<br />
Ladies, change is never easy. As Alisa says, &quot;You take what information you can use now and you can always go back and incorporate the rest later&quot;. It's not an all or nothing process. By putting certain changes into action, you will see first hand what your awesome, powerful, strong bodies can do. This was and will continue to be a life-changing event in my life. And can you believe all these good things started with two cysts... <br />

I met Alisa and Jessica through my acupuncturist, Raven Koch, this past February. When I spoke with Alisa I just signed up even though I was afraid and had my doubts.  I felt I had no other choice because I've had irregular periods since I was 20.  I'm now 32 and I've always been overweight.  Basically, I grew up on the Great American Diet of white bread and the other garbage that goes with that.  I really have not known how to eat right and at 250 lbs I had to do something or else I'm heading for Type 2 Diabetes. It's serious and scary.  I've had acid reflux, irregular periods, and basically I'm a sugar addict.  I have also had a hard time dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression.  This program has taught me how to eat and helped me get off medication.  I was on Metformin for PCOS, which I've stopped taking since starting my program, and I got my period this morning for the second month in a row!  Sometimes I'd gone for years without getting my period, so this is incredible. <br />
<br />
I've lost almost 2 sizes - my old size 22s don't fit at all.  I'm now wearing a 20 and soon it will be an 18, since the 20s are a bit big. I'm feeling more comfortable although I'm not there yet.  I signed up for the 3 month program and just decided to extend it for another 2 months since I really want to stay on track and learn more.  Overall my liver is feeling better, which was confirmed by my acupuncturist. I've been sleeping so much better at night and not as depressed.  I feel even hopeful... it's Spring and I'm feeling refreshed... especially because I just finished the cleanse.  It's so nice to be part of a community of women who support and help each other towards learning to be healthy. Last night after writing this, I had a dream about the ladies at Laughing Sage.  It was like my bed was right in their office and so it was like them working around me.  I felt so taken care of.  It was a nice feeling. <br />

Condition: Painful Periods </strong> <br />
<br />
At the start of LSW I was not sure what I was looking for. I knew I had painful periods, a hectic lifestyle, irregular eating and was looking for a bit of clarity and coaching for those areas of my life. I knew if I had some lifestyle coaching I could possible see some dramatic changes in my life. I already owned a successful Pilates studio in Fairfield County, have a wonderful husband of 1 1/2 years and am in great shape...I truly thought I had everything under control. I later found that this control was what was causing all the problems! <br />
<br />
Soon after starting my LSW program, I discovered that my lack of self-care was making me a resentful, dehydrated, undernourished woman. Following their simple recommendations, within 6 sessions at LSW I had developed a much better relationship with my body and my husband because I was honoring myself. It was wonderful! When I actually slowed down and looked at where my life was going I realized that I wanted a baby. This was NOT what I had expected to find out about myself through this program, BUT, of course all the time honored for myself and my husband....we were pregnant within a month! So here I am now 3 months pregnant, not at all where my mind told me I would be before starting the program. <br />
<br />
What I have taken from this program ( and I'm not done yet!) is to honor my cycle, my own rhythm, and listen to my heart instead of my head. My head would have given me all the reasons not to get pregnant and if I hadn't started listening to my body and my heart, I know that I would not be pregnant now. I did not know how to access the tools to reach this choice before Laughing Sage and I am so grateful for this program. This baby is on its way because I made space for it. There was no room with my hectic, controlling lifestyle 6 months ago. ! I know that I will be a successful mother, wife and business owner because I have been shown how to use the tools that I already had. I feel like I am in the flow of my life now. <br /><br /><br /><br />

"Angel" Alisa Vitti is a God send for women! My fast paced stressed out NYC lifestyle, combined with the loss of some family members, emotional trauma and a painful breakup, took a complete toll on my body and spirit. With one look at me and in one session, Alisa knew exactly what was wrong with my endocrine and digestive systems and put me on a diet, herbal supplements and healing exercises that had me sleeping, holding down food and emotionally healing in a matter of days. She treats every aspect of your life with so much compassion and care that it's like I "woke up" and got my LIFE fixed and I love the woman she helped me become! I had a rolodex of 6000 Dr's and healers from my years running the Learning Annex but chose her because she healed friends who battled illnesses for years and they were changed from the inside out - I wanted their happiness and now I have it!  As a bonus, I lost 10 lbs my first week on her cleanse and am almost back to my college weight and my skin is glowing. Trust me she is a miracle worker! <br />

Condition: PCOS, Fertility </strong> <br />
<br />
It must have been approx. 2 and a 1/2 years ago that I began the program, as I wanted help with my PCOS and general self-care including healthy eating. I had been on the pill for over 16 years when I began the program and was scared to go off. I would laugh and say, "I'm afraid I'll turn into a man." Frankly, I knew better than to say such things, but that is the thought I would have. I just didn't know what my hormones would do. <br />
<br />
So, by the end of my 6-month program I was taking the leap, going off the pill and was delighted to learn that I could in fact have a monthly period without the pill. I had been to the gynecologist at least once a year for 16 years and not once did anyone suggest I take a break or try life without the pill (something that I began questioning and made me angry later). Everyone, myself included, just assumed it was better for me to be on the pill. <br />
<br />
So, right about the same time I took this powerful leap I began dating a wonderful man who is now my husband. Jen and I had talked about what kind of a man I was looking for, making myself ready for such a man. As an aside, I knew him for 13 years before we "noticed" each other and found our way to one another, so the old saying that he might be right under your nose does apply! (More hope for some of you!) And, I found my dream job and saw to it that I obtained it!!! <br />
<br />
We married over a year ago and are expecting our first child and couldn't be happier. It was so incredible to be able to go into the doctor's offices and be able to tell them that without a doubt I was ovulating, even though I had PCOS. Due to my age (then 38) and PCOS twice I was asked if I'd like to go to a fertility specialist and I was able to confidently say, "No thank you. Not yet. Give us a little time." It may not sound very romantic, but because I had learned so much about my cycles and ovulation I was learning that we always seemed to be having sex before and after I ovulated. I had a strong sense we weren't infertile, we just weren't ready to see to it that we got pregnant. <br />
<br />
Well, we both know the weekend we became pregnant, my ovulation sticks in tow, and to us it is extremely romantic, to have made such a conscious decision to bring a child into this incredibly flawed and amazing world we're living in. My husband was impressed by my awareness. You know, if we'd needed to use Clomid or something else to become pregnant that would have been just as sacred as us not needing it. I am just so proud of myself for learning about my body and trusting in it long enough to not be pushed around by anyone, especially the medical professionals. <br />
<br />
So thank you, thank you, thank you to Alisa for creating this empowering program and to my former HHC Jen. I wish all of you my very best on your journeys. Now on to as natural and conscious a birth as possible!!! <br />

Conditions: Irregular, Painful Periods </strong> <br />
<br />
About a year after moving to New York City, I started having two periods per month, sometimes menstruating for 14 days at a time. They were incredibly painful, my emotions were all over the place, and my skin was breaking out like never before. I often experienced bleeding during sexual contact, and was consumed with worry about my health. I consulted several doctors, and each one gave the same answer -- "I don't know what to do about this." I was confused, frustrated, and scared when an enlightened friend referred me to LSW. <br />
<br />
In my consultation with Alisa, I knew I was in the right place when she said, "Don't worry -- I know what's going on here." Feeling heard, acknowledged, and loved in that call was my first step towards healing. <br />
<br />
My work with Alisa was nothing short of a miracle. I started feeling better after the very first session, and began to create a new dialogue with my body. She is a wise and empathetic listener, and I felt wrapped in love and healing energy after every session. She introduced me to new, delicious foods and powerful supplements that helped my body return to its natural balance. We also addressed the ways in which my work and relationships were affecting my health. Most importantly, though, she gave me a true peace of mind, and helped me get rid of my own judgment and shame about the messages my body was sending me. Alisa created a safe space and guided me gently into embracing and nurturing my feminine energy. By the end of my program, I felt juicy, healthy, alive, and more comfortable with my sexuality and my body than ever before. Through LSW, I now have one normal period per month, without use of any drugs! I don't experience the pain or emotional turbulence that I did before, and have learned how to create healthy boundaries in my life to keep stress levels down. My skin is clear and gorgeous, and I enjoy nurturing myself with whole, fresh foods (and the occasional cupcake of course...). <br />
<br />
I would recommend LSW to any woman, whether she is struggling with her health or simply wishes to live her best life. It is the best thing I have ever done for my health. <br />

Conditions: Fibroids, Mittleschmerz (pain during ovulation) </strong> <br />
<br />
Let me start off by saying Thank You from the bottom of my ovaries, for Laughing Sage Wellness!  Alisa and the team at LSW are truly amazing women. <br />
<br />
For twenty years, I have been suffering from terrible ovarian pain. It would happen faithfully every month, mid cycle, and a lot of the time the pain was unbearable. I come from an old fashioned family, which believes if you splash cold water on your face, get some fresh air, and walk it off, then all of your ailments should go away. Well let me tell you ladies...this remedy did not work! <br />
<br />
I had gone to my doctor, and she found that I had fibroids on my left ovary. The problem was that the pain was on my right side. She also told me that I have something called Mittleschmerz, which refers to ovarian pain during ovulation. My doctor suggested that I either go on birth control and or steroids, neither of which she could say would actually work. <br />
<br />
It didn't seem right to me to take medication so this was not an option. So she suggested that I rest, and limit my activity, i.e., no exercise, not a lot of movement, lots of water, and some pain relievers. That is terrific advice for someone who has a hangover, but not for someone that has such a physical job and lifestyle such as me. So I went on with my ovarian pain life, and dealt with it best I could, until Laughing Sage entered my life. <br />
<br />
The program was truly a Godsend on a lot of levels. My counselor tuned right into me. She listened to me and all of my complaints. She told me that she was going to help me make peace with my period and that I would practice "sending love to my ovaries."  Admittedly, I thought to myself, Love my period? Send love to my ovaries? Are you kidding me? However, I was in enough pain to try all the new hormonal balancing foods and to even send love to my ovaries. After following the program, my ovarian pain is completely gone. I still can't believe it. My counselor even told me how long it was going to take to feel a difference, and she was right on. Ladies, if I can give you any advice, let Laughing Sage Wellness into your life. 
  Oh guess what? I love my period, and send love to my ovaries... who knew? <br />
<br /><br />
