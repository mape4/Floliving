<h2><strong>The answer you’ve been waiting for!</strong></h2>
If you absolutely cannot settle any longer for your frustrating menstrual symptoms, your fertility challenges, or your lack of energy or libido, you’ve come to the right place.

Welcome!

I’m Alisa and I’m here to share with you the secret of how I transformed my life through balancing my hormones, and how you can do the same.

At my worst state of health, I weighed 200 pounds, I had severe cystic acne on my face chest and back, I was deeply depressed, and I had my period only about three times a year. It was quite traumatic.

After seeing the limitations of traditional medicine for my chronic hormonal issue, I spent years in self-experimentation, trying all kinds of alternative therapies until I finally found the magic recipe that was unique to me.

<strong>I healed my body because I HAD to. I could not settle for living a life in pain and frustration, a life divorced from my body.</strong>

I then became a health coach because <strong>I could not settle for a lifestyle that didn’t align with my body’s newly discovered needs and the new relationship I created with my body</strong>. And I got in touch with the fact that I deeply wanted to teach other women how to do the same.

<strong>I wanted other women to be able to see the world beyond their symptoms and live a life they love with passion and purpose.</strong>

If you’d like to hear more about my story, check out my TEDx talk here:

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9vKRj9yV8pI" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>

So that’s why I’m here and why I’ve created this in-depth educational program designed to guide you in creating balance with your hormones and a new relationship with your body so that you can create a life you truly love!
<h2><strong>Knowing if it’s right for YOU.</strong></h2>
See if you resonate with any of the following:

You are dealing with Period Problems:
<ul>
	<li>irregular or painful cycles</li>
	<li>PMS</li>
	<li>cysts</li>
	<li>fibroids</li>
	<li>amenorrhea</li>
</ul>
You have Fertility Concerns
<ul>
	<li>you’re trying to conceive naturally</li>
	<li>you want to improve the chances of IVF or IUI working</li>
	<li>you want to do everything you can preserve your fertility naturally to set you up for the future</li>
</ul>
Your Energy &amp; Libido are less than par:
<ul>
	<li>chronic fatigue</li>
	<li>anxiety</li>
	<li>depression</li>
	<li>mood swings</li>
	<li>premature aging</li>
	<li>less than desired sexual response</li>
</ul>
You’re Generally Healthy but know Something is Missing:
<ul>
	<li>you want to harness the 4 phases of your cycle to be more successful in your life, career, and relationships</li>
	<li>you are tired of being on birth control pills and want to step into your natural FLO</li>
</ul>
You’ve wasted too much time and money treating all your symptoms separately and without getting the results you wanted.

You’re tired of quick fixes that don’t create lasting changes.

You KNOW that there's something out of balance with your body even though the doctor's think you’re crazy.

You want a drug-free and surgery-free solution.

You want to be looked at as a whole person, not just a pile of symptoms that need to be treated.

You are ready to get the right information and get your life back on track!

You’re not dealing with health issues but you recognize that you could be using your hormonal biochemistry to your advantage

YES?

The <strong>Hormonal Sync System</strong> speaks to all of that and more.

If you’re ready for a lasting transformation, please read on ;)
<h2><strong>Why FLO? Why now?</strong></h2>
There is a silent epidemic happening in our country. Women’s hormonal balance is being destroyed. Women have more and do more and yet women are exhibiting more and more symptoms of a deficient endocrine function. Women's bodies are breaking down just when we need them the most.

Current trends in diet and lifestyle are afflicting women of all ages with issues around their reproductive health -- from their teen years to their conception years, and finally in their menopausal years.

Rates of gynecological conditions and infertility are at an all time high and women need a solution to restore their balance, preserve their fertility, and maintain youthful hormonal patterns in their bodies.

<strong>Women are doing all that they can to succeed in life at the expense of their bodies, their health, their fertility, and their joy.</strong>

We end up out of the FLO – out of the zone of possibility and serendipity. We’re not happy, we’re not healthy, and we don’t know how to get back on that vibration where everything is just flowing in our lives. This is the 21st century!

<strong>We need to leave behind all the things that no longer serve us</strong> – from beliefs around what success looks like, to paradigms for loving partnership, and especially to the way we think about and treat our bodies and health.

We have hot technology, an array of social media– everything is so next generation, and yet we women in so many ways are still operating on a dial-up connection!

<strong>Not knowing how to operate and maintain your health and your body as a springboard for your best life is just not acceptable anymore and too many of you are online searching, searching, searching for the answer finding nothing and continuing to suffer needlessly.</strong>
<h2><strong>What’s the solution then?</strong></h2>
It’s living in your <strong>FLO</strong>. You know when you’re in the FLO of things – everything falls into place, you feel amazing, you have opportunities come your way easily.

<strong>I can tell you that there is a METHOD to FINDING YOUR FLO and then MAINTAINING it!</strong>

Why? Because living in harmony with your body is essential to a happy and successful life.

Rather than forcing our bodies to deal with the (sometimes unreasonable) demands we place on them, it’s time to embrace our biochemistry and learn how to live in sync with our bodies!

<em>“I am proud to say that because of the FLO Living program, <strong>my periods are now regular and I've finally dropped the last 5 pounds that I never was able to lose.</strong> <strong>Wooo hoo!</strong>” – Carrie</em>

<em>“Throughout my FLO program, <strong>my skin cleared up, my ovarian pain diminished, I lost the rest of my baby weight, and most importantly I found an amazing sense of peace in my life overall - peace with body image, having another child, my work. </strong></em>

<em>As a bonus, <strong>my sexual relationship with my husband has blossomed. I feel more productive in my life - even in everyday chores.</strong> Life is more fun! I am completely letting go and couldn't feel more free and light about doing so!</em>

<strong>FLO’s approach is different than anything I have ever tried and so effective at achieving results</strong>.” - Alexandra

<em>“I originally came to FLO Living for the specific purpose of doing something to restore my libido. I had no idea that it would turn out to be such a life-changing experience. Through the program, <strong>I not only rediscovered my libido, but along the way I redefined my concept of sexuality and redefined for myself what "life success" really means to me,</strong> which has enabled me to live and love more fully. <strong>The program more than exceeded my expectations...it made me a new woman!</strong>” - Fran</em>
