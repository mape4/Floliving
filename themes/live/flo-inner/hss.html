<em>“I am proud to say that because of the FLO Living program, <strong>my periods are now regular and I've finally dropped the last 5 pounds that I never was able to lose.</strong> <strong>Wooo hoo!</strong>” – Carrie</em>

<em>“Throughout my FLO program, <strong>my skin cleared up, my ovarian pain diminished, I lost the rest of my baby weight, and most importantly I found an amazing sense of peace in my life overall - peace with body image, having another child, my work.</strong></em>

<em>As a bonus, <strong>my sexual relationship with my husband has blossomed. I feel more productive in my life - even in everyday chores.</strong> Life is more fun! I am completely letting go and couldn't feel more free and light about doing so!</em>

<strong>FLO’s approach is different than anything I have ever tried and so effective at achieving results</strong>.” - Alexandra

<em>“I originally came to FLO Living for the specific purpose of doing something to restore my libido. I had no idea that it would turn out to be such a life-changing experience. Through the program, <strong>I not only rediscovered my libido, but along the way I redefined my concept of sexuality and redefined for myself what "life success" really means to me,</strong> which has enabled me to live and love more fully. <strong>The program more than exceeded my expectations...it made me a new woman!</strong>” - Fran</em>
