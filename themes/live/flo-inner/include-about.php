Alisa Vitti, HHC, AADP (Holistic Health Counselor, American Association of Drugless Practitioners) founded Laughing Sage Wellness Center, now the FLO Living Center (www.FLOliving.com) in Manhattan 9 years ago after experiencing the many frustrating health symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and then healing herself through food and lifestyle changes. She received degrees from Johns Hopkins University and the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, where she fine-tuned her unique approach to helping younger women naturally correct hormonal imbalances using medicinal foods. She was recently selected as Hay House’s first Mover&Shaker and will be speaking at their “I Can Do It” conference in November 2010. Alisa was also featured in Dr. Northrup’s recently revised Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom.<br />
<br />
She specializes in the areas of reproductive and hormonal health and helping women connect to and express their feminine energy. A transformational speaker, she debunks myths around women’s chronic gynecological issues and inspires women to have better health and better sex through her five-step proprietary nutritional and lifestyle protocol. Her protocol is now the subject of a clinical study in conjunction with a research physician from Columbia University. Alisa has spoken at numerous colleges, workshops, corporations, and women’s organizations. Her work has been featured in the Huffington Post, Fox Business News, Life & Style, Vital Juice Daily, and various internet radio shows. She is a featured expert blogger for SavvyAuntie.com, FertilityAuthority.com, HealthyStyleNY.com and other prominent site. She is currently writing her first book due out in 2012.<br />
<br />
Since 2001, her center has worked with thousands of women in five continents, helping them regain their hormonal balance, get pregnant naturally, lose weight, clear skin, heal cystic ovaries, eliminate PMS, regulate periods, and increase energy and libido. Women deserve to know there is another option besides drugs, surgery, or “come back in six months for another check up”. More than that, FLO Living helps women live their best and most powerful lives by learning how to own and operate their biochemistry.<br />
