<strong>Living in the FLO: </strong>The Real Fountain of Youth for Conscious Women 
In this video from the Hay House workshop presented in March 2010 , Alisa  will shares  the tools and protocols she developed for her clients to:<br><br>

<strong>Find your FLO: </strong>Tap into the ìbleeding edgeî of functional medicine and learn how to relieve the symptoms and underlying causes of chronic GYN and hormonal challenges.<br><br>
<strong>Stay in your FLO:</strong> Learn the daily practices involved in living from the Feminine Flow Zoneô so you can prevent hormonal imbalances, adrenal and chronic fatigue, and live in an empowered state of womanhood.
Expand your FLO: Gain unadulterated access to your personal power so you can channel your energy into your life's purpose rather than running the "hamster wheel" of healing and recovery from self-sabotage.<br><br>
