== Description ==

> __Support for this plugin & documentation on the <a href="http://www.seodenver.com/rich-text-tags/">official plugin page</a>__

### A TinyMCE Editor for Tags, Categories, and Taxonomies ###
The Rich Text Tags Plugin allows you to edit tag descriptions, category descriptions, and taxonomy descriptions using Wordpress' built in rich-text editor. Switch between WYSIWYG and HTML editing modes with the click of a link. Use the WordPress uploader to insert images from your computer or site's Media Library.

Use the PHP functions `tag_description()` and `category_description()` in your theme to show the descriptions. To learn how to show taxonomy descriptions, <a href="http://www.seodenver.com/rich-text-tags/" rel="nofollow">read more on the plugin page</a>.
